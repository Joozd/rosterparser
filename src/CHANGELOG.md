# RosterParser Changelog

## Version 0.1
Initial version.
Beta version, mostly meant for internal testing. Can be used though. Should be mostly stable.

### Version 1.11
- Added Test Parser to provide users with an easy way to get correct results without having to inject mocked RosterParsers into tests.
- Improved testing on my side
- Added support for (my old) LogTen Pro text files.
